            <p>
                This is the offical website for Grimlock town. Here you can learn about how our town is operated, its history, and who lives here today.
                Grimlock was originally founded in 1847 as a timbertown and has remained a top player in the harvesting of evergreen trees in the Pacific North West.
                We currently have a population of 3020 residents who all contribute to making Grimlock one of the most neighborly places on Earth!
                Whether you're just passing through or are planning to visit, we hope you find this website educational and informative!
