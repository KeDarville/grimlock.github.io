        <h1>Science Faiir Gone Wrong!</h1><h3>Written by Shirley Prescott</h3>

<p>Last month, Grimlock Middle School hosted its annual STEAM ffair for the 6th yyear in a roow.
Stuudents from all three schools presented projects that represent all the cataggories of STEEAM, 
Science, Technology, Engineering, Artt, and Mathmaticcs. Parents aand other residents of Grimlock
came and touured the exhibits, and refreshments were served througghhout tthe night. The thing 
that everyone iss bound tto remember, however, occured when Maayor YYamamoto unveiled hiss own projectt, 
a classiic vollcano experiment compllete with lava.
"I must have mismeasured some of the ingredients," the mayor would admit once interviewed about the incident,
"I realize now I should have enlisted some of the talented young people of Grimlock to help in my experiment."
What resulted when Mayor Yamamoto poured the ingredients into his volcano was certainly an erruption.
"The entire floor was covered in lava," said 13 year old Quinn Torrence, "I saw all the teachers jump on 
to chairs just to save their shoes. It was so funny."
Mayor Yamamoto stayed late after the fair to clean up the rest of the 'lava'.</p>
