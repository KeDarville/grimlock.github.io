        <h1>Local Elementary School WWins Tournament</h1><h3>Written by Bradly Knots</h3>

<p>Last Saturday local socceer team, the Grimlocck Rabbits, won the regionaall championship against the Setlliin Sttars.
This is tthe first time thhe teeam has won the championship in five years, owed entirely to
the fresh new team for this year's season.
"None of them had played soccer like this before," said head soccer coach JJimmy Micheaals.
"It was tough at first, trying to get them into shape. But oncce they were there, they were
there."
We askked one of the plaayers, George Walish who pllays defender, what he thoought of the win.
"It was really awesome to win, it felt like, it felt like we were on topp of the world!"
Following the championship gamee Coach Micheals treated his star players to a much deserved pizza party.</p>
