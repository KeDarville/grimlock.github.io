                <h2>Mayor Robert Yamamoto</h2>
                <p>Mayor Yamamoto has served Grimlock as mayor for the past 15 years. Under his leadership Grimlock has succeeded in completely
                    renovating Grimlock Elementary, Middle School, and High School. He has also worked with Wilson Grim to 
                    revitalize the exporting of timber from the rich forests around Grimlock, allowing the city to prosper. He can often be found 
                    at one of the schools, either giving lectures to the teens of the town on the importance of being involved with city politics
                    or volunteering wherever an extra hand is needed.

                <h2>Wilson Grim</h2>
                <p>Wilson Grim is the current owner of the lumber yards that make up most of Grimlock's income. His family, the Grims, were 
                    the original founders of Grimlock and have owned the yards longer than the town has been around. Wilson Grim himself has not only 
                    donated generously to both the education system but also the hospital, allowing Grimlock General to expand its Emergency Room and ICU.
                    Wilson Grim is said to employ around a third of all the citizens of Grimlock.
